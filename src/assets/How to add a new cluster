Open Clusters.ts file from the /src/app folder
Tip: Have a look at one of the previously defined clusters to have an idea

1. Add cluster name in the 'clusters' array

2. Just before the last '}' add a new object in the following format:

    A. the name of the object is exactly same as the cluster name added in step 1.
    B. the object will contain several multidimensional arrays one for each of the panel, the structure of a multidimensional array is as follows:
        a. the heading of an array will be one of the following {'WaterDispenseData', 'RoData', 'CupDispenseData', 'transaction', 'supervisorData', 'operator'}
        b. each multidimensional array will contain 4 SubArrays(SA)
            SA1: The name of the columns in the sql database table of that panel as strings
            SA2: The corresponding name which are to be displayed in the dashboard as strings
            SA3: The corresponding units (tip: Leave a blank string if there is no unit corresponding to a cloumn).
            SA4: The corresponding (to the panel) table name in sql database

3. Add a new column (with the same name given in step1) to the Dashboard_Users table.

4. Add new DeviceID(s) to the Device_Data table in the database.

Your new cluuster has now been added into the dashboard.
